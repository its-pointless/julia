pkg will often attempt to download and inatall prebuilt linux binaries that won't
work. installing packages that link to libraries is a bit tricky and requires
wiriting deps.jl yourself so the library string points to installed termux libs.
Even if you can compile the libs using julia, without setting
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to where julia installed the libs it won't use them
causing error.
